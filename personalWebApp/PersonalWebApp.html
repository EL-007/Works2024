            <h3>My Work Section</h3>
            <h4>GUI App</h4>
            <p>Pair programming project. Teamate: Katherine Nguyen. <br> We tried to create a java app for a functions math quiz practice! <br> Wins: We made a working app with 2 functions equations! <br> Challenges we faced: We tried multiple-choice question answer, but didn't completely progress through :(</p>

            <p>With my teamate we split the jobs with one person code while the other think of ideas(equations), and we switch roles in between. In the quiz we ask the user the final answer of a math equation and use while loops until the user gets the question correct and pass to the next one. Next, im looking forward to complete the challenge, add some designs, and add more questions :) </p>

            <h4>Interactive(Culmination) App</h4>
            <p>ICS3U1 Culminating Project <br> I tried to create a website for people to debate on interesting and wild topics!!! <br> Wins: The display on desktop window looks fine for now :) (better in the future)<br> Challenges I faced: I'll still need to improve on locating structures/boxes, I also need to learn more on website window positions(for various platform/devices)</p>
            <p><img src="./截屏2024-06-15 01.30.13.png" alt="App Image"> Preview Image of the Interactive App</p>
            <p>In HIMOP there is a main home page "Planet Home" and weekly there will be a debate question app-wide for anyone to respond to. On the top and sides are navigation/guides to click to. In future, i'm looking to complete user functions(login, custom profile, posting questions and commenting, custom settings, and more...) and also if possible to make the website public with friend's ad sponsers :) </p>
